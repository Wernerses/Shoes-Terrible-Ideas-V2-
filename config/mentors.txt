#List users here to be made mentors with the format: ckey = rank name.
#Ckey will be converted to ckey format, lowercase with no punctuation except '@'.
#Rank name will match anything after ' = ' and has no format requirements.
#Ranks will match to those with the same name in mentor_ranks.txt, if a match isn't found the user won't have any permissions besides None
#If SQL-based mentor loading is enabled, mentors listed here will always be loaded first and will override any duplicate entries in the database.
