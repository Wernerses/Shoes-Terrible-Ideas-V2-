#Mentor Rank format follows exactly the same format as Admin Ranks.
#If SQL-based mentor loading is enabled, ranks and their keywords listed here will be loaded first and override any with the same name loaded from the database.
#
#The following are valid permission keywords:
#HEADMENTOR = allows you to promote and/or demote mentors.
#MENTOR = general mentor tools, verbs etc.
#AUTOMENTOR = mentor gains powers upon connect. This defaults to on, you can exclude AUTOMENTOR to make a role require using the rementor verb to gain powers (this does not effect the mentor's ability to walk past bans or other on-connect limitations like panic bunker or pop limit).
#@ = special keyword for the current permission type that adds all the keywords that the preceding rank has of the same type.
