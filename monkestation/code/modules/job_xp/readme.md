## Title: <!--Title of your addition-->

<!-- uppercase, underscore_connected name of your module, that you use to mark files-->

MODULE ID: JOB_XP

### Description:

This PR adds an xp system for each job in the game aswell as the framework for job milestones

Milestone Guide: Milestones are sorted by key*id where key_id is equal to a jobs title(use JOB* Helper for this)
There are than 2 milestone lists you can add items to, the first of which is a permenant fixture like a loadout item, the second of which is the in_round_list which takes an item and that item can be redeemed each round as a reward.
to write one of these simply create a list like so:
list(
"{level}" = {path},
)
Note that the level is in string format. Loadout items should have the loadout path, round items should have the item id.
