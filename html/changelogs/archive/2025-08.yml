      to be true as to what it actually displays.

  - rscadd: dominate no longer requires facing your target
  - rscadd: bloodsuckers can only have 1 targeted ability active at a time, you couldn't
      multicast before anyway.
  - rscadd: Mesmerize is now slowed down/blocked with welding protection, with levels
      past 2 making you immune (welding protection is level 2)
  - rscadd: Dominate now has a visual timer for when your vassal dies horribly

  Melbert:
  - refactor: Over 200 item interactions have been refactored to use a newer, easier-to-use
      system. Report any oddities with using items on other objects you may see (such
      as surgery, reagent containers like cups and spray bottles, or construction
      devices), especially using something at range (such as guns or chisels)
  - refactor: Item-On-Modsuit interactions have changed slightly. While on combat
      mode, you will attempt to "use" the item on the suit instead of inserting it
      into the suit's storage. This means being on combat mode while the suit's panel
      is open will block you from inserting items entirely via click (but other methods
      such as hotkey, clicking on the storage boxes, and mousedrop will still work).
  - refactor: The detective's scanner will now be inserted into storage items if clicked
      normally, and will scan the storage item if on combat mode

  Absolucy, Melbert:
  - bugfix: Hierophant Club Blink at range
  - bugfix: Crusher Loot
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Storage and Tables are now a lower priority action, meaning some uses
      of items on storage should work... better, now. Here's hoping at least, report
      any oddities.
  - refactor: 'Note: For an overwhelming majority of items, combat mode will attempt
      to attack/insert into the target, while non-combat-mode will attempt to use
      on a target. This means screwdrivering or emagging a MODsuit must be done on
      non-combat-mode, as combat mode will simply put the screwdriver or emag into
      its storage. Same applies to tables, though when in doubt, RMB may help (for
      things which are also weapons, like mops).'
  - refactor: Refactored escape pod storage, now they actually properly show as unlocked
      on red alert and above.
